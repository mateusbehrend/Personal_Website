9a. I used both a gradient, and many instances of shadows to make elements on my page pop. Textwise I included both a text shadow and a gradient on my main header title.
9b. I pretty much used relative units and the clamp() function everywhere in my CSS. Two such examples are:
h1 { font-size: clamp(1.25rem, 6vw, 2.5rem); }
section > h2 { font-size: clamp(1.75rem, 4vw, 2.5rem); }

12. b,c,a
    (b) I used many instances of box shadow, using its effects on the navigation bar, skill blocks, project cards, etc. (c) For hover on project cards, and skill cards I give it a lift effect with transforming it up a bit. I also use transforms to create the animation for the opening and closing of the hamburger navigation bar. (a) I use a CSS gradient on the main title for the page.

//break (VScode casting 18 and 19 as 13 and 14 for some reason)

18. a, b.
    I used both inline SVG for feeback form for chat bubble. I also used ::before and ::after. One place I used was creating the gradient glow for my profile picture.

19. (Repeat)

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")

---

My javascript sets the default appearance based on the user's default settings, either light mode or dark mode. If there is no preference it uses the system's prefered color. The javascript also has a toggle for light and dark mode, changing the color scheme displayed, stores the choice in the local storage, and displays the appropriate icon by changing the image source in the DOM.
The javascript also toggles the difference visibility modes that the navigation bar has. It toggles between the full-width display, and the "hamburger" compressed mode. It does this by changing the class mode, which causes the css animation to occur.
Lastly, my javascript also displays the current value of the feeback slider as the user changes it.
